    <ol>
        <li>Sieve the all-purpose flour (maida), salt, baking soda and baking powder in a mixing bowl. Then add the semolina and sugar to the sifted ingredients.</li>
        <li>Now add the curd (yogurt). With a spoon mix the yogurt with the sifted ingredients.</li>
        <li>Adding 2 to 3 tablespoons water in parts and at intervals, first mix well and then start kneading. Knead to a smooth, supple and soft dough.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a wet cotton napkin and keep aside to rest for 30 to 45 minutes or up-to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Later pinch medium sized balls from the dough. Roll each ball between your palms to a round shape.</li>
        <li>Keep the dough ball on your work surface and flatten lightly with your fingers. Spread a bit of oil on both sides of the dough ball.</li>
        <li>In a kadai or wok, keep oil for deep frying on medium-high flame. Drop the rolled dough in hot oil and it will start puffing within a minute.</li>
        <li>When the sizzling of the oil stops, turn over and fry the other side. You can flip once or twice for even cooking.</li>
        <li>When light golden or golden, remove the bhatura and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil. This way fry the bhatura in batches.</li>
